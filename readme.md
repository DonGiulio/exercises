The tiny projects included in this repository are simple ruby/Ruby on Rails exercises, they are published here so that I can share them more easily. 

The exercises are written with clarity and readability in mind, I understand that something could have been done better, faster, with more engineering, or just smarter. This was not my objective when solving them, the goal was to find a solution quickly and efficiently. 

They are all strictly implemented in a TDD fashion and no features/functionalitieshave been implemented other than the ones strictly requested by the exercise, with a YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) approach always in mind.

## Organisation
This repository is made of several directories, each directory contains a solution to a different exercise, so they are separate projects. 

Each directory contains a `readme` file containing information about the exercise and instructions on how to run it.
